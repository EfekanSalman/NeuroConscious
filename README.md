# 🧠 NeuroConscious: Artificial Consciousness Engine

**NeuroConscious** is an experimental artificial consciousness engine built with a modular, object-oriented Python architecture.

Inspired by cognitive architectures, biological models, and agent-based systems, this project simulates an internal state, mood system, and motivation cycle for artificial agents interacting with a virtual world.

### 🧬 Key Features

- Modular internal state system (e.g., hunger, fatigue, mood)
- Strategy-based mood calculation (easy to extend or swap)
- Motivation engine for autonomous decision-making
- Agent-environment interaction
- Designed with Clean Code and SOLID principles
- Easily extensible for research or AI experimentation

---

### 🎯 Purpose

The goal of NeuroConscious is to provide a minimal, extensible foundation for simulating biologically inspired conscious-like behaviors in artificial agents. It aims to serve as an open-source testbed for:

- Cognitive neuroscience simulations  
- AI-driven autonomous agent design  
- Consciousness modeling and decision-making theories  
- Educational and experimental use cases
